									<h2 class="major">Background</h2>
									<p> Having a Singaporean
										background, I was born and
										raised in Australia. I mainly
										speak English at home.

										<br> I enjoy going on long walks
										with my dog, Milo. Strolling
										along beaches and forests
										often gives me creative
										inspiration for my artwork. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Interest In IT</h2>
									<p> My interest in IT mainly lies
										in technology support,
										network administration,
										computer graphics and
										digital animation.

										I have always been
										fascinated by the
										complexity of operating
										systems, how computers
										work together each other across
										networks, and the
										advancement of digital art
										in comparison to traditional
										art.

										My interest for IT started
										with my first PC. As it was
										once used by my parents, I
										had a lot to learn in order to
										make it my own. Since it
										was running on an
										outdated OS, I had
										to understand how to
										optimize and maintain the
										computer in order to
										repurpose it for my uses.</p>

									<p>This is a job listing for an IT Support Administrator. The main
										purpose of this role is to provide IT support for Microsoft Dynamics

										<h3 class="major">Personal Profile</h3>
										<p> <b>MBTI:</b> INFJ</p>
										<p> <b>Big Five Personality Test: </b>
											<br> Openness: <b> 92% </b>
											<br> Conscientiousness: <b> 59% </b>
											<br> Extraversion: <b> 5% </b>
											<br> Agreeableness: <b> 81% </b>
											<br> Neuroticism: <b> 85% </b>
											</p>

											<p> <b> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b> <br>
												<br> The results are my personality put into words and numbers. I
												am categorized into a group of people so it is made easier for
												others to understand what kind of personality I might have. I
												think it is somewhat accurate. <br> 

									</div>
									<div class="span-3">

										<p>	<br> <b> How do you think these results influence your behaviour in a
											team? </b> <br> 
	
											<br> The results wouldn't influence my behaviour when it comes
											to working with a team. After all, it is more important that I
											focus on working with my team rather than think about test
											results that criticize my personality. <br> 
											
											<br> <b> How should you take this into account when forming a
												team? </b> <br> 

												<br> I should make use of the strengths that an INFJ personality
												type has, such as being organized, creative and having
												attention to detail.</p> </p>

										<h3 class="major">Project Idea</h3>
										<p> My project idea would be an ecommerce platform/app that allows
											users to be able to rent items/goods and to lease items themselves
											as well. I would like to think that it is similar to Ebay/Facebook
											Marketplace, but with a focus on purely renting and leasing. <br>

											<br> It would be an alternative option to rental companies, as well as a
											way for others to earn extra income/save their money rather than
											having to go through the trouble of keeping an item and leaving it
											unused. Increasing the accessibility of things that are expensive to
											purchase and would only be used occasionally is the main goal of
											this platform, such as a lawnmowers, deep fryers, surfboards,
											cameras, etc. <br> 

											<br> Supposedly, the platform would be based online as a website, and
											can be accessed through an app as well.</p> 
											
									</div>
									<div class="span-4-5">

										<p> <b> Home Page </b> <br>
											At the home page, the user interface is designed to be accessible
											and easy to use with helpful features such as a search bar, live chat,
											tiles of equipment catergories, personalized items, and a survey
											option to go through a series of questionaires to narrow down what
											is needed for the user.
											</p>

											<p> <b> Search Engine </b> <br> 
											The search bar will consist of filters to help the user to find what
											they are looking for. These filters help by sorting available items into
											catergories such as; item type, location of item, feedback reviews,
											pricing, and keywords. </p>

											<p> <b> Survey Option </b> <br> 
											The survey will ask the user a series of questions to help them find
											what they're looking for. These questions will change based on the
											answer given by the user, and is a step-by-step process to find a
											specific item. By the end of the survey, items are shown and sorted
											based on the answers given by the user. </p>

											<p> <b> Item Listings </b> <br> 
											Elements such as a description by the lister, images with zoom-in
											functionality, pricing, map location, and reviews by other users who
											have rented from the lister will be shown in the item listing. </p> 

											<p> <b> Checkout Process </b> <br> 
											The website will make use of a payment platform such as
											Cybersource to handle transactions. Offering more payment
											options is an important aspect of the platform, as it makes it
											accessible to everyone. </p> 

									</div>
									<div class="span-4-5">

										<p> <b> Security Deposits </b> <br> 
											As a requirement in the process of renting a product, users will
											have to make a deposit to the lister as a guarantee that the terms
											and conditions of the listing is abided by. </p> 

										<p> <b> Intergrated Blog Section </b> <br> 
											Releasing blogs and articles with helpful tips on how to make use
											of the platform's features will enable users to utilize it to their
											needs. These can be relevant to the website or can also be about
											things not directly related to the platform. Users can have blogs of
											their own, primarily to announce a product available for rent. </p> 

										<p> <b> Personalization And Accessibility Features </b> <br> 
											Users are able to adjust their preffered language, customize their
											profile, shop and item listings, and blog. In addition to
											personalization, the platform is designed with accessibility for
											everyone in mind. To achieve this, multiple colourblind modes and
											a high contrast setting that can adjust text and menus
											independently will be provided for users, as well as a text-to-speech
											narrator option that reads text and other elements aloud. The
											menus can also be customized, with font sizes for text and UI sizes
											for menus. </p> 

										<p> <b> Loyalty Program </b> <br> 
											For each item a user rents and successfully returns, as well as each
											item a lister recieves good feedback for, they will recieve an amount
											of rewards points. They can redeem points for discount codes, onetime use double revenue, and rewards. 
											Users can also earn points by referring the platform to others, if 
											a successful renting of item is made by said others. </p> 

									</div>
									<div class="span-3">

										<p> <b> Message System </b> <br> 
											An intergrated messaging system will be available for users to
											communicate to each other, as well as customer service. </p> 

										<p> <b> Message System </b> <br> 
											Based on the feedback a user/lister recieves, they will obtain
											varying statuses associated with their profile to show that they are
											trusted. </p> 

										<p> Other Features Include: <b> 
											
											<br> -Wishlist

											<br> -Personalized Items At Home Page

											<br> -Breadcrumb Navigation

											<br> -Promotional Codes

											<br> -Ability To Share To Social Platforms (Including Email)

											<br> -Store and Customer Management For Listers

											<br> -Blog and Order/Shipping Management For Listers

											<br> -Customer Service Live Chat To Help Users

											<br> -FAQ Section </p> </b>

										<h2 class="major">Summary</h2>

										<p> As the project needs to take into consideration the budget and key
											features the platform would have, the best option for the
											website/app could possibly be software such as BigCommerce or
											Shopify, seeing that they are also to be mobile compatible when it
											comes to app development. </p> 

										<p> Skills that may be required to complete this project could consist of
											programming and website development knowledge, but thankfully
											both BigCommerce and Shopify seem user-friendly enough to
											develop an ecommerce website on. However, if one wanted to have
											physical servers then BigCommerce would be a suitable option as
											Shopify websites can only be hosted on the cloud. </p> 

										<p> The platform aims to provide the general population with an
											alternative option (rather than rental companies that may be too
											expensive) To rent everyday items for an affordable price, as well as
											a way for others to earn extra income from their unused
											belongings. Things that would normally be expensive and rarely
											used can now be made more accessible through renting. The
											platform also makes it a priority to incoporate accessibility features,
											as everyone should be able to make use of the website/app for their
											daily necessities. </p>
